# Training Configuration (Override)
# ============================================================
train:
  model_name: "yolov8m.pt"  # Larger model
  imgsz: 768
  epochs: 100
  batch: 4  # Smaller batch due to larger model
  lr0: 0.0005  # Lower LR for larger model
  
  # Patience for early stopping
  patience: 30

# Notes
# ============================================================
notes: |
  Larger model with more parameters.
  - Better capacity for learning complex patterns
  - Slower training and inference
  - May overfit on small dataset (232 images)
  - Reduced batch size due to memory constraints
